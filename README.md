# FCC-25plus5-Clock

This was put together for the Front End Development Libraries course on [FCC](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/fcc21752981-84f1-47db-a786-eea26f47141e/front-end-development-libraries). The aim was to create a web app consisting of custom react components. The application uses JSX and is compiled via babel (npm script `npm generate`).

A demo can be found [here](https://normanrichardson.github.io/FCC-25plus5-Clock/). The unit tests by selecting the "hamburger menu" in the top left and selecting the "25 + 5 Clock option".
